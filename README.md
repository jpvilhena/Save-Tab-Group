# <img src="public/icons/icon_48.png" width="45" align="left"> Save Tab Group

  I noticed that when I save a group of tabs on google chrome, those tabs are still allocated in my memory.
  
  So I made this plugin to save and open tabs from txt files, this way, the use can come back from where they were
without sacrificing their memory.

## Features

- Save a group of tabs as a txt file with the urls separated by paragraphs
- Open a group of tabs from a txt file, with the urls separated by paragraphs

## Install

This is not compiled, in order to open it as an extension you must enable developer mode on chrome and "Load unpack", selecting the build folder

## Contribution

Suggestions and pull requests are welcomed!.
